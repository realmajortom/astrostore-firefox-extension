AstroStore firefox extension for quickly adding bookmarks!


## Deploy locally for testing
- Clone repo to you local computer
- In Firefox, go to "about:debugging"
- Choose "Load Temporary Add-On..." and select one of the files in the "build" folder

If all goes well, a little space man should appear in your browser toolbar :)
