# AstroStore Firefox Extension
A companion to AstroStore for bookmarking on the fly

# Introduction
This extension places an icon in your search bar, which you can click to save your current page to AstroStore. 

Like the main app at astrostore.io, this tool is designed to be privacy-respecting. The extensions doesn't recieve any data from your browser until the icon is clicked, at which point the current tab url and title are requested.
